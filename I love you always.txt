Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles win windless summer night 
Secrets moments shared withing shared withing the heart of the Out of the stillsness, softwares 
spoken words
Say it, say if again
I love you always forever.
Near or far closer together
Everywhere I will with you 
Say it, say it again
everything I will do you for you
You've got
The most unbeliveble blue eyes You've got
Me almost melthing alway
As we lay there
Under a blues sky with pure white stars
Under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetwears
A magical stars
Say it say it again
Me almost melthing alway
Under a blues sky with pure white stars
